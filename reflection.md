Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I consulted with students sitting behind me in class before the lecture started on Tuesday as well as students at my table at office hours on Monday. I was able to work through some issues with programming the beginning with a type of "loop" in which I was able to run a certain number of rounds. I was able to help them with the word mirroring. 
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended office hours on Monday with Jordan as well as TA hours Wednesday night from 7-9pm. 
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
It's very different than Python, but still some basic coding from CSC110 I am able to connect it to. It's going to be a learning curve but attending office hours will become very helpful. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
There are similarities with how I constuct my lines, indentation and how things are necessarily "formatted".
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I'm not going to lie, this was a hard assignment for me. Attending additonal hours proved necessary for this assignment as I got very little done on my own. Attending additional hours is very necessary. Talking to other people as well as the professor and TAs is very needed. Would like to work more on simplifcation of code beyond just writting it out. Office hours were helpful in simplifacation but when running program and adding things in it was more helpful to expand my code. I also would like a recap on capitalization and [0] vs like a [1] or higher place in the code.
